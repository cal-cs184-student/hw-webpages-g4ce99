		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p> In Section 1 we built out methods based on Bezier durves to build meshes for surfaces, and in section 2 we did 3 tasks building out the infrastructure for mesh upsampling with several transformations, and brought them together for part 6 to upsample the entire mesh, smoothing it out.
			Overall, we both found it really interesting to learn to implement triangle meshes operations and were blown away by the amazing meshes we were able to create/upsample with our code.
		</p>

		<h2>Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

		<h3>Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>
		<p>
			de Casteljau's algorithm iteratively interpolates between the control points that define a bezier curve. 
			With each step, the number of points reduce by 1 — and we finally end up with just one final point for each t.
			In our implementation, each point \(P_i^{j+1}\) in the \({j+1}\)th set of points was calculated using the following formula:
			\[P_i^{j+1} = (1-t) * P_i^j + t * P_{i+1}^j\]
			By scanning over all values of t, our implementation is able to generate each point along the Bezier curve and ultimately render the curve using these points.

		<h3>Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
		<p>
			We extended the de Casteljau algorithm to generate three dimensional Bezier surfaces by performing it along two axes instead of one. 
			Given a matrix of control points we first find the point on the curve of every row using the de Casteljau algorithm. 
			Then, we use these new points as control points for a new bezier curve in order to find a point on our Bezier surface.

		<h2>Section II: Triangle Meshes and Half-Edge Data Structure</h2>

		<h3>Part 3: Area-weighted vertex normals</h3>
		<p>
			We loop over all faces the vector has by repeatedly going to the initial half edge's twin, followed by next. 
			Before we try to calculate the normal, we ensure that the half edge isn't on the boundary. 
			We don't need to calculate the area since this is part of the normal's magnitude — so we can just sum the normals, and then divide by the sum of their norms.

		</div>

		<h3>Part 4: Edge flip</h3>
		<p>
			We don't create any new entities in our implementation — instead, we symbolically refer to the relevant half edges and change their properties (vertex of origin, next halfedge, face) in order to flip the desired edge. 
			For convenience, and to avoid bugs, we fetch all relevant entities, naming them based on the figure describing the flip transformation in the HW spec. 
			The debugging journey wasn't particularly interesting here, although we did spend a bunch of time thinking about how we could do this cleanly.

		<h3>Part 5: Edge split</h3>
		<p>
			Our key step in trying to have some semblance of neatness in this part was to move the vertex b to where m is. 
			Unfortunately we did not consider a crucial aspect: that the vertex b has edges from other triangles connected to it as well, resulting in the mesh being messed up.
		</p>
		<p>
			After debugging this, our implementation created a new vertex for m, but moved the bc edge to become mc, and tried to keep most elements of our previous attempt in that we could cleanly create the bottom triangle, and re-use the upper triangle.

		<h3>Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>
		<p>
			First, we iterated over all vertices to calculate new positions for them, and mark them as not being new. 
			Next we computed the the new edge positions (the vertex positions we store in the edges!), and mark all the edges as not being new. 
			After that, we loop over all edges again (unless it is new, or connected to a new node) — and split it. 
			Next, we flip all edges that connect an old and new vertex together. 
			Finally, we update each vertex's position with what is stored in newPosition.
		</p>
		<p>
			We ran into initial bugs about iterating through edges, but after reading the guide, we identified that it is because the mesh is being updated as the loop goes on. 
			So, we used the while loop approach described to fix this.

		</div>
		
		<p>
			We notice how after this upsampling the cube's mesh becomes much more rounded. 
			The asymmetricness of this happens due to the lack of consistency in the direction of the diagonals. 
			This can be resolved to create a symmetric smoothing by splitting the diagonal on each face — creating a central new vertex on each face too.
		</p>

		</figure>

		<p>
			However, this cube still suffers from the issue of edge and corner rounding that we noticed was occuring after several rounds of upsampling. 
			We experimented and found some success at maintaining corners with the following preprocessing procedure:
		</p>
		<p>
			1. Split every face. <br />
			2. Split every edge of the cube(only those where two square faces meet). <br />
			3. The cube should now be composed of many subcubes that the process can be repeated on until satisfied. 
		</p>
		<p>
			An example of a cube before and after subdivision using this scheme are shown below. 
			This method was effective because it provides the desired cube symmetries while increasing the density of points in the square. 
			Thus, the sharpness of the corners is reduced at deeper levels.
